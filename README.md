Hello! This is my semester long project for my IT114 class, a mulitplayer rps game with both hosting and local playing capabitlies. As of my final submission for this class, there still exists some bugs and things to implement within the final milestone, so that will be one of my goals for my 2024 winter break. I will also be making this repository public soon, just want to make sure everything is in good shape before the release to the public world.
